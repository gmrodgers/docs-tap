# Services Toolkit

Services Toolkit ("STK" for short) is responsible for backing many of the most exciting and powerful services capabilities in Tanzu Application Platform ("TAP" for short). From the integration of an endless list of cloud-based and on-prem services, through to the offering and discovery of those services, and finally to the claiming and binding of service instances to application workloads, services toolkit has the tools you need to make working with services on TAP simple, easy and effective.

## Capabilities

The main capabilities on offer in TAP through services toolkit are:

1. The classes and claims abstraction - providing a simple, but powerful, user experience to apps teams, while serving to promote a strong separation of concerns between apps teams and ops teams alike
1. Dynamic provisioning of service instances - providing an ability for apps teams to create service instances that adhere to company policy on-demand and as needed, without incurring any untoward delay
1. Seamless integration of almost any service, cloud-based or on-prem, into TAP with minimal configuration overhead - providing a near-limitless range of services to help boost developer productivity

## Where to start

If this is your first time working with services on TAP, then a great place to start are the [Claim services on Tanzu Application Platform](../getting-started/claim-services.hbs.md) and [Consume services on Tanzu Application Platform](../getting-started/consume-services.hbs.md) walkthroughs. This walkthrough runs through the basics and should leave you ready and wanting more! After which you can return here to the services toolkit component documentation to continue your services journey on TAP.

## How this documentation is organized

The services toolkit component documentation is loosely based around the framework laid out by https://documentation.divio.com/. As such, it primarily consists of [tutorials](./tutorials.hbs.md), [how-to guides](./how-to-guides.hbs.md), [explanations](./explanation.hbs.md) and [reference material](./reference.hbs.md). Which section to choose from will depend on what you are hoping to achieve.
